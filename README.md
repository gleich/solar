## ❓ What is solar?

Solar is a command line tool for cloning every repo that your github account has starred. It is designed for offline use and was created for the [hackclub Zephyr trip](https://zephyr.hackclub.com). It will clone repos under the file format of `./OWNER/NAME`. Besides cloning solar also allows you to search over the cloned repos making it easy to find what you might be looking for. Searching is currently planned for solar version 2.0.

## 🚀 Install

### 🍎 macOS

Simply install via the homebrew tap:

```bash
brew install gleich/homebrew-taps/solar
```

### 🖥️ Linux and Windows

You can grab the binary from the [latest release](https://github.com/gleich/solar/releases/latest)

## 📟 Commands

### 🛰️ `solar download`

`solar download` will download all starred repos and will ask you a few questions before running. When it comes to making the PAT (personal access token) you can just create one with no scopes selected.
